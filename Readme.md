# **Assignment T1A2** - *Stuart Nicoll*

## About my website

My website has been designed as part of our first assignment. It is primarily a port folio site to show case our work to other students, teachers and possibly one day prospective employers.

The function of the website is to learn new skills and to provide information.


## These are the links for the assignment
